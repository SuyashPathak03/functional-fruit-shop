I **checked the repository you shared** ([https://github.com/SuyashPathak03/functional-fruit-shop](https://github.com/SuyashPathak03/functional-fruit-shop)) but **there’s no existing `README.md` content visible** in the default view online. So I’ll create a clear and helpful **README** you can add to your project.

* View total bill

## 🧠 Tech Stack
